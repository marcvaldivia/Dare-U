## What is Dare-U
Dare-U is an innovative platform that allows you to challenge your friends. Simply add your contacts, present your challenge and await for an answer. With Dare-U you can answer all your challenges privately with a picture or a video, it is that simple. You decide what challenges you want to share publicly and those that you want to maintain private. All those challenges that you decide to make public, will be seen by all users who have added you.

## Why Open Source
Dare-U started at the end of 2015. After a pair of months without any update, the app was losing users and I decided to change the server by another cheaper (before that, I used Google Cloud). Due to my lack of dedication and the lack of active users I gave up to continue developing the app. That's the reason why I'm putting the project on GitHub, I want that anybody can see and use my code for their own projects, or may be, continue with the development of Dare-U.</br>

## Project Structure
This project is separated in 3 parts. The Android app, the PHP server (2 versions, for Google Cloud 'AppEngine' and for an Apache Server) and the MySQL database.
